## Description

Generic Webcomic aims to be a general purpose theme for comics. It offers basic features like character tags and bio pages, a chapter listing on the 'About' page, a page for displaying fan art or other gallery images, a page for outgoing links, and a news category for displaying news separately from comic posts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Why did you make this?

A number of comics creators have gotten frustrated with webcomics platforms recently and have expressed interest in having their comic on their own site, but they lack the skills to put it all together. This is my effort to help people take that step toward independence by providing not only a theme for a comic website, but a tutorial to put it all together.
